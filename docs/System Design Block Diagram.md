PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)

Brain of the system.

Reads sensor inputs and controls motors/actuators.

Implements ladder logic for start/stop, product counting, and packaging.

Conveyor Motor(s)

Moves products along the line.

Controlled by PLC outputs.

Sensors

Photoelectric or limit switches detect products.

Send signals to PLC for product presence, jam detection, or sorting.

Actuators

Pneumatic cylinders or robotic arms for packaging.

Controlled by PLC based on sensor input and sequence logic.

HMI / SCADA

Interface for operator control.

Shows system status, counters, alarms, and allows start/stop commands.

Operator / Monitoring

Uses HMI to interact with the system.

Can control conveyor speed, start/stop line, and monitor errors.
