**PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)**

- Brain of the system.

- Reads sensor inputs and controls motors/actuators.

- Implements ladder logic for start/stop, product counting, and packaging.

**Conveyor Motor(s)**

- Moves products along the line.

- Controlled by PLC outputs.

**Sensors**

- Photoelectric or limit switches detect products.

- Send signals to PLC for product presence, jam detection, or sorting.

**Actuators**

- Pneumatic cylinders or robotic arms for packaging.

- Controlled by PLC based on sensor input and sequence logic.

**HMI / SCADA**

- Interface for operator control.

- Shows system status, counters, alarms, and allows start/stop commands.

**Operator / Monitoring**

- Uses HMI to interact with the system.

- Can control conveyor speed, start/stop line, and monitor errors.
